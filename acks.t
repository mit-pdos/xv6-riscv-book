.chapterlike "Foreword and acknowledgements"

This is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It
explains the main concepts of operating systems by studying an example
kernel, named xv6.  xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken
Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of
v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for an x86-based multiprocessor.

The text should be read along with the source code for xv6. This approach is
inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer to Peer
Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000)). See also
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2007/v6.html, which provides pointers to on-line
resources for v6.

We have used this text in 6.828, the operating system class at MIT.  We thank the
faculty, TAs, and students of 6.828 who all directly or indirectly contributed
to xv6.  In particular, we would like to thank Austin Clements and Nickolai
Zeldovich.
