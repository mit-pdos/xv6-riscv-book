.chapterlike "Foreword and acknowledgements"

This is a draft text intended for a class on operating systems. It
explains the main concepts of operating systems by studying an example
kernel, named xv6.  xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken
Thompson's Unix Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of
v6, but is implemented in ANSI C for an x86-based multiprocessor.

The text should be read along with the source code for xv6. This approach is
inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer to Peer
Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14, 2000)). See
https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828 for pointers to on-line
resources for v6 and xv6.

We have used this text in 6.828, the operating systems class at MIT.  We thank
the faculty, teaching assistants, and students of 6.828 who have all directly or
indirectly contributed to xv6.  In particular, we would like to thank Austin
Clements and Nickolai Zeldovich.  Finally, we would like to thank people who
emailed us bugs in the text: Abutalib Aghayev, Sebastian Boehm, Raphael
Carvalho, Color Fuzzy, Giuseppe, Jacek Masiulaniec, Askar Safin, Pawel Szczurko,
Warren Tooney, and Zou Chang Wei.

If you spot errors or have suggestions for improvement, please send email to
Frans Kaashoek and Robert Morris (kaashoek,rtm@csail.mit.edu).
